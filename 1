[04-07 06:21:31|INFO|cosmos1/models/diffusion/inference/world_generation_pipeline.py:597:generate] Run with prompt: The camera first locks onto the elephant’s injured leg, capturing the raw severity of the wound. Blood seeps through the rough, wrinkled skin, contrasting starkly against its thick, gray hide. The close-up shot lingers, emphasizing the deep gash and the subtle trembling of the leg, making the pain feel immediate and visceral. Each detail—the coarse texture of the skin, the slow trickle of blood, the slight quiver of strained muscles—heightens the sense of vulnerability.

[04-07 06:21:31|INFO|cosmos1/models/diffusion/inference/world_generation_pipeline.py:599:generate] Run with negative prompt: The video captures a series of frames showing ugly scenes, static with no motion, motion blur, over-saturation, shaky footage, low resolution, grainy texture, pixelated images, poorly lit areas, underexposed and overexposed scenes, poor color balance, washed out colors, choppy sequences, jerky movements, low frame rate, artifacting, color banding, unnatural transitions, outdated special effects, fake elements, unconvincing visuals, poorly edited content, jump cuts, visual noise, and flickering. Overall, the video is of poor quality.
